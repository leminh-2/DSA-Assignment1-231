## About files
* **Textbook pdf**: for completing _PURPLE_ command

* **Restaurant_origin.cpp**: from here, you can write **Restaurant.cpp** like me

* **Restaurant_pseudoCode.cpp**: if there's some confusion when reading **Restaurant.cpp**, you can read this file to see how i design the function

## Note
* In **Restaurant.cpp**, i have written some functions with name <display....> and cout function to check the logic, i have turn them into comment. If you want to run that, Replace "//cout" with "cout", "//display" with "display" before run main.cpp

* In assignment _Specification file_, some spec are so tricky, dont care about that, you can understand how it is in **Restaurant.cpp**
